# RubyFPV: Open Source Digital FPV Radio System - RTL8814U Support
Ruby is a full open source solution (hardware and software) for robust end to end digital radio links, designed specifically for controlling and managing UAVs/drones/planes/cars and other remote vehicles

Read more about Ruby, including how to setup, install and use your Ruby systems, here: https://rubyfpv.com/


# Features highlights:

<B>Mutiple, rendundant radio links on 433/868/915 Mhz and 2.4/5.8 Ghz bands:</B>

Multiple redundant radio links in different bands (433Mhz, 868/915Mhz, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 5.8Ghz) can be used simultaneously between vehicles, ground control stations and relays for better resilience, link quality and range;

<B>Relaying:</B>

Mobile (vehicles) and/or fixed relay nodes can be inserted in the system for longer range and penetration beyond line of sight;

<B>Encryption:</B>

The radio links can be encrypted end to end so that only authorized components can decode the radio data;

Note: Encryption is temporarly disabled due to...[reasons]


<B>Live video, audio, telemetry, remote control, auxiliary & custom data streams:</B>

By default Ruby supports all the required data capabilities for UAVs (video, telemetry, control and user defined data streams).

<B>Rich user interface/control interface;</B>

<B>SDKs for third party development of new features:</B>

There are public SDKs available so that 3rd parties can add custom functionalities and capabilities to Ruby system.

# Building the code

If you need help building this code, contact Petru Soroaga on this forum:
https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3880253-Ruby-Digital-radio-RC-FPV-system-%28v-7-2-core-SDKs%29

or by sending an email to petrusoroaga@yahoo.com, providing a short explanation of what you are trying to accomplish.

# Building the project and installing RTL88XXAU driver

To build RubyFPV you need the common development tools found in `build-essential`,
the kernel headers for your running kernel and the `wiringPi` library. Once these
packages are installed you can compile the sources by running `make`.

Some radio modules use the RTL88XXAU Wiâ€‘Fi chipset. RubyFPV provides a helper
script that downloads and builds this driver. Run it with root privileges so the
modules are installed system-wide:

```bash
sudo scripts/install_rtw8814au_driver.sh
```

The script verifies dependencies, compiles the driver and installs it for the
current kernel.

# Adding code

You can create pull requests, if that's what you really want, and I will code review them.

# SSH default logins

To login using SSH to your hardware (for debuging purposes), use these credentials:
* Raspberry: pi/raspberry
* Radxa: radxa/radxa
* OpenIPC hardware: root/12345

# Adding support for new hardware

If you are a hardware manufacturer and you want to add support in Ruby for your device (be it a SBC, camera, radio module, etc), please contact us at the address above.
